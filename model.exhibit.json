It combines the representation of regional agricultural policies and production with political and economic conditions on regional, Member State, EU and global agricultural commodity markets. An activity based approach allows the direct implementation of relevant CAP policy measures and the technological definition of appropriate environmental indicators related to the agricultural production activities. Product and activity coverage are in line with the Eurostats Economic Accounts for Agriculture (EAA) by a combined top-down \u002F bottom-up approach.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u000D\u000A",

The shock may be either a change in policy, a change in economic assumptions or another change to a model variable.\u0026nbsp; The analysis can be either forward looking (ex-ante) or evaluating previous developments in an ex-post manner.\u0026nbsp; Scenarios can be used either to assess policy, or to assess sensitivities to key inputs (eg international energy prices).\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u000D\u000A\u000D\u000A\u003Cp\u003EFor ex-ante analysis a baseline forecast up to 2050 is required; E3ME is usually calibrated to match a set of projections that are published by the European Commission and IEA.\u0026nbsp; The scenarios represent alternative versions of the future based on a different set of inputs.\u0026nbsp; By comparing the outcomes to the baseline (usually in percentage terms), the effects of the change in inputs can be determined.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u000D\u000A\u000D\u000A\u003Cp\u003EIt is possible to set up a scenario in which any of the model\u0026rsquo;s inputs or variables are changed.\u0026nbsp; In the case of exogenous inputs, such as population or energy prices, this is straight forward.\u0026nbsp; However, it is also possible to add shocks to other model variables.\u0026nbsp; For example, investment is endogenously determined by E3ME, but additional exogenous investment (eg through an increase in public investment expenditure) can also be modelled as part of a scenario input.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u000D\u000A\u000D\u000A\u003Cp\u003EModel-based scenario analyses often focus on changes in price because this is easy to quantify and represent in the model structure.\u0026nbsp;

However, it is also possible to assess the effects of regulation, albeit with an assumption about effectiveness and cost.\u0026nbsp; For example, an increase in vehicle fuel-efficiency standards could be assessed in the model with an assumption about how efficient vehicles become, and the cost of these measures.\u0026nbsp; This would be entered into the model as a higher price for cars and a reduction in fuel consumption (all other things being equal).\u0026nbsp; E3ME could then be used to determine:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u000D\u000A\u000D\u000A\u003Cul\u003E\u000D\u000A\u0009\u003Cli\u003Esecondary effects, for example on fuel suppliers\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u000D\u000A\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\u000D\u000A\u000D\u000A\u003Cul\u003E\u000D\u000A\u0009\u003Cli\u003Erebound effects\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\u002F\u002Fbeta.liaise-toolbox.eu\u002Fnode\u002F891\u002Fedit#_ftn1\u0022 name=\u0022_ftnref1\u0022 title=\u0022\u0022\u003E[2]\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u000D\u000A\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\u000D\u000A\u000D\u000A\u003Ch2\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\u000D\u000A\u000D\u000A\u003Ch2\u003ELimitations to the analysis\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\u000D\u000A\u000D\u000A\u003Cp\u003EThe main limitation of E3ME is the sectoral disaggregation of its sectors.\u0026nbsp; The industry classification is relatively detailed, covering up to 69 sectors at the NACE 2-digit level.\u0026nbsp; However, due to the availability of the data, it is not possible to go into more detail, for example to the firm-based level, or to very detailed product groups.\u0026nbsp; For this type of analysis our recommendation is that the model (which provides an indication of indirect effects) is used in conjunction with a more detailed bottom-up or econometric analysis (which can capture detailed industry-specific effects).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u000D\u000A\u000D\u000A\u003Cp\u003EThe other main limitations to the model relate to its dimensions and boundaries.\u0026nbsp; Broadly speaking E3ME covers the economy, energy and material demands and atmospheric emissions.\u0026nbsp; While it is possible to provide an assessment of other policy areas, it is necessary to make assumptions about how this is translated into model inputs.\u0026nbsp; It should be noted that the E3ME_Global edition will eliminate one limitation of the current E3ME model which treats regions outside Europe as exogenous. \u0026nbsp;All world regions will be endogenously modelled in the new model version.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u000D\u000A\u000D\u000A\u003Cdiv\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u000D\u000A\u003Chr align=\u0022left\u0022 size=\u00221\u0022 width=\u002233%\u0022 \u002F\u003E\u000D\u000A\u003Cdiv id=\u0022ftn1\u0022\u003E\u000D\u000A\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\u002F\u002Fbeta.liaise-toolbox.eu\u002Fnode\u002F891\u002Fedit#_ftnref1\u0022 name=\u0022_ftn1\u0022 title=\u0022\u0022\u003E[1]\u003C\u002Fa\u003E In the example, the higher fuel efficiency effectively reduces the cost of motoring.\u0026nbsp;
