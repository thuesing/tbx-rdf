The shock may be either a change in policy, a change in economic assumptions or another change to a model variable.\u0026nbsp; The analysis can be either forward looking (ex-ante) or evaluating previous developments in an ex-post manner.\u0026nbsp; Scenarios can be used either to assess policy, or to assess sensitivities to key inputs (eg international energy prices).\u003C\/div\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EFor ex-ante analysis a baseline forecast up to 2050 is required; E3ME is usually calibrated to match a set of projections that are published by the European Commission and IEA.\u0026nbsp; The scenarios represent alternative versions of the future based on a different set of inputs.\u0026nbsp; By comparing the outcomes to the baseline (usually in percentage terms), the effects of the change in inputs can be determined.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is possible to set up a scenario in which any of the model\u0026rsquo;s inputs or variables are changed.\u0026nbsp; In the case of exogenous inputs, such as population or energy prices, this is straight forward.\u0026nbsp; However, it is also possible to add shocks to other model variables.\u0026nbsp; For example, investment is endogenously determined by E3ME, but additional exogenous investment (eg through an increase in public investment expenditure) can also be modelled as part of a scenario input.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EModel-based scenario analyses often focus on changes in price because this is easy to quantify and represent in the model structure.\u0026nbsp;

The industry classification is relatively detailed, covering up to 69 sectors at the NACE 2-digit level.\u0026nbsp; However, due to the availability of the data, it is not possible to go into more detail, for example to the firm-based level, or to very detailed product groups.\u0026nbsp;

Broadly speaking E3ME covers the economy, energy and material demands and atmospheric emissions.\u0026nbsp; While it is possible to provide an assessment of other policy areas, it is necessary to make assumptions about how this is translated into model inputs.\u0026nbsp; It should be noted that the E3ME_Global edition will eliminate one limitation of the current E3ME model which treats regions outside Europe as exogenous. \u0026nbsp;All world regions will be endogenously modelled in the new model version.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\u0026nbsp;\r\n\u003Chr align=\u0022left\u0022 size=\u00221\u0022 width=\u002233%\u0022 \/\u003E\r\n\u003Cdiv id=\u0022ftn1\u0022\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/beta.liaise-toolbox.eu\/node\/891\/edit#_ftnref1\u0022 name=\u0022_ftn1\u0022 title=\u0022\u0022\u003E[1]\u003C\/a\u003E In the example, the higher fuel efficiency effectively reduces the cost of motoring.\u0026nbsp;

It is expressed as the difference between the pre-tax and the post-tax balue of the firm at the end of the  period. The calculations take an industry-specific mix of assets and liabilites as a starting point. In order to determine the periodical post tax profits, the tax liabilites are derived by taking into account the tax base regulations in great detail.

This guarantees consistent linkage of trade volumes and prices for 25 commodities and a service sector. Exports of one country have to be imports of another country and so at the global level the trade system is closed.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nWithin each country, the economies are modelled using either a macro model (MM) or input-output model (IOM).  The difference is the sectoral coverage, which is missing from the macro model; where possible the IOM is used but due to data limitations this is restricted to 21 countries.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nThe IO models describe the production technology in the countries as reflected in the input structures. Energy-emission models (EEM) are based on energy balances of the International Energy Agency and are available for all countries and regions distinguished in the model. In the EEM energy demand and supply are consistently linked for 12 energy carriers to the economic driving forces that are explained in the economic part of the model. Carbon emissions result from the use of fossil fuels.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nMaterial inputs have also been integrated into the modelling system. For all countries resource-use extraction in tons is explained for six categories. Their development is either driven by economic activity or energy demand for fossil fuels. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\n",

For forecasting transport flows, the model refers to the NEAC database that provides information on transport flows between regions. The underlying theory is that trade is the result of the specialisation of countries or regions. Besides the supply and demand factors (gravity model based on supply factors of the exporting country\/region and the demand factors of the importing country\/region) there is also a \u0027resistance\u0027 on the trade such as transport costs, imposed tariffs, and cultural differences. Also there can be favourable circumstances to trade within a group of countries due to the establishment of free-trade zones.  A range of more specific NEAC models that can be coupled with the database has been developed. These include:  \u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u00c2\u0095 a trade model for forecasting of future trade flows\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u00c2\u0095 a modal-split model (estimation and forecasting of modal-split)\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u00c2\u0095 an assignment model (assignment of traffic flows on transport networks)\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u00c2\u0095 a container forecasting model (estimation of containerised transport)\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u00c2\u0095 an environment model (calculation of emissions resulting from transport\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u00c2\u0095 the EcoNEAC model (estimation of the effect of transport and infrastructure on the economy)\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n",

The spatial integration of the vulnerability maps in the DSS enables the regional authorities to design and assess policies for the optimal agricultural development and the groundwater protection from the agricultural land uses.

      "field_body":"WorldScan is a recursive dynamic general equilibrium model to explore and analyse long-term issues in the world economy. The model is used as a tool to construct long-term scenarios and as an instrument for policy-impact assessment. WorldScan fits into the tradition of applied general equilibrium models in that it builds upon neoclassical theory, has strong micro-foundations and explicitly determines simultaneous equilibrium on a large number of markets. The model is solved as an equation system and thus is cast in a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) format.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nDedicated versions of WorldScan exist and they are extensions of a core version in separate directions. These extensions are:\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u00c2\u0095 a climate-change version;\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u00c2\u0095 an energy version;\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u00c2\u0095 a version with R\u0026D spillovers; \u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u00c2\u0095 a version with imperfect competition",
